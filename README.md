# Tournament Prize Distribution Contract

## 📝 Project Description
This smart contract allows tournament organizers to fairly distribute prize money among winners in a trustless and transparent manner using Ethereum smart contracts. It is designed to automate prize transfers directly to the winners' wallets, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## 🚀 Project Vision
To empower eSports and gaming communities by making reward distribution instant, decentralized, and verifiable, ultimately promoting transparency and fairness in online and offline tournaments.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Ownership Restriction:** Only the contract owner (organizer) can set winners and trigger distribution.
- **Fair Split:** Distributes prize pool equally among all winners.
- **One-time Distribution:** Ensures prize is distributed only once to avoid double-spending.

## 🔭 Future Scope
- Add support for tiered reward distributions (1st, 2nd, 3rd place).
- Use Chainlink VRF for randomized winner selection.
- Integrate with gaming platforms or NFT reward mechanisms.
- Introduce prize claim window and proof-of-win verification (e.g., tournament ID oracles).
